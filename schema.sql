-- ------------------------------------------- [ext] structured API fields
-- Wallapop returns all of these; they were previously being re-derived from
-- free text (or ignored). Written as idempotent ALTERs so an existing project
-- can be migrated by re-running this file.

alter table listings add column if not exists whole_machine boolean default false;

  -- (its price is not a comp for a loose card) but NOT from alerts.
alter table listings add column if not exists posted_at timestamptz;

alter table listings add column if not exists user_allows_shipping boolean;
  -- this seller's choice on this listing, distinct from `shipping`
  -- (item_is_shippable), which is only the category's general capability
-- Product family and capacity. Both were removed once, when phone tracking was
-- reverted and nothing wrote them; both are back because iPhones are tracked
-- again — for comps only, never for alerts (alert_loop.ALERTING_FAMILIES).
--
-- `family` is what makes a mixed registry safe to query: "what is a 4070 worth"
-- and "what is a 15 Pro worth" are the same question over the same tables, and
-- without this column the only way to tell a card row from a handset row is to
-- pattern-match the model_key.
alter table listings add column if not exists family text;
  -- 'gpu' | 'phone'
alter table listings add column if not exists storage text;
  -- phones: '128gb' | '256gb' | '512gb' | '1tb' — the biggest price driver
  -- within one model, recorded now so the pools can be split by capacity later
  -- without a backfill that no longer has the titles to parse.
create index if not exists listings_family_idx on listings (family);

alter table listings add column if not exists country text;
  -- 'ES' | 'PT' | 'IT' | ... Wallapop is one shared cross-border marketplace
  -- and both loops search it nationwide, so the country is the only thing
  -- distinguishing a card you can collect from one that has to ship from Milan.
  -- parse_item has extracted it (and a test has asserted it) since the
  -- nationwide switch, and alert_loop.listing_row has written it — but the
  -- column was never created, so every fresh process sent one batch that failed
  -- with PGRST204, logged the "apply the ALTER statements" warning, dropped the
  -- field and carried on. The value was never once persisted.
alter table listings add column if not exists seller_id text;
  -- the seller behind the listing, and the cheapest noise filter available:
  -- the same replica or empty-box listing reappears under a fresh item_id every
  -- few days, which defeats the (item_id, price) alert dedup completely. The
  -- seller is the only identifier that survives a relisting.
  -- config.BLOCKED_SELLERS is applied against this.
alter table listings add column if not exists modified_at timestamptz;
  -- the seller's own last-edit timestamp. This is the "just cut the price"
  -- signal; without it the alert loop can only infer a cut from its own
  -- sent_alerts history, so a price cut on a listing it never alerted on is
  -- invisible to it.

create index if not exists listings_posted_at_idx on listings (posted_at desc);

-- whole_machine feeds a `not whole_machine` predicate in the sold-comps query,
-- and in Postgres `= false` excludes NULL. Every row written before the column
-- existed — or during a window where db.Database._missing_columns had stripped
-- it from the payload — carries NULL there and was permanently invisible to
-- that query, silently shrinking the sold pool with no way to notice.
--
-- The query side is now NULL-tolerant, but a column whose meaning depends on
-- every reader remembering that is a trap, so the invariant is made true at the
-- storage layer as well. All three statements are safe to re-run: the update
-- matches nothing once it has run, and set default / set not null are no-ops on
-- a column that already has them.

-- delete each purge slice issues. On the largest table in the database that is
-- a sequential scan per slice, which is precisely the statement-timeout (57014)
-- failure the slicing logic was written to avoid — and when the purge times out
-- nothing is deleted, so the table only grows and the next run fails harder.
-- junk_exclusions has had this index since it blew the quota; observations,

  -- cannot tell "12 real 4060 Ti 16GB comps" apart from "1 of its own plus 11

-- ---------------------------------------------------- [ext] junk audit log
-- Every filtered listing, so you can tune the phrase list without guessing.
create table if not exists junk_exclusions (
  id         bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  item_id    text,
  title      text,
  phrase     text,                 -- the phrase that matched
  category   text,                 -- DEFECT | WANTED | TRADE | NOT_A_CARD
  seen_at    timestamptz default now()
);

-- One row per listing, not one per listing per run. Without this the same
-- exclusion was re-inserted every 5 minutes for as long as the listing stayed
-- up (~288 rows/day each), which reached 2.86M rows in 16 days and exhausted
-- the free-tier quota.
--
-- This index is now load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces: db.log_junk()
-- upserts on item_id with resolution=ignore-duplicates and no longer reads the
-- table back first. It used to, and it lost the race routinely — both loops run
-- overlapping schedules over a shared discovery keyword space, so both see the
-- same new junk listing within seconds, and whichever inserted second hit this
-- index and crashed its whole run over a filter-tuning table. Enforcing the
-- invariant in one place that all writers share is what makes that collision a
-- no-op instead.
--
-- THE DEDUP BELOW IS NOT OPTIONAL, and it is why this file used to appear to
-- apply cleanly while leaving the index uncreated. `create unique index` fails
-- on a table that already contains duplicate item_ids — and this table was 97%
-- duplicates, which is the entire reason the index is wanted. Postgres then
-- answers the deduplicating upsert with 42P10 ("no unique or exclusion
-- constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification"), which took the alert
-- loop down on the first run after the upsert shipped. db.log_junk now detects
-- that and falls back, so this is a performance and hygiene fix rather than an
-- outage, but the fast path stays off until the index exists.
--
-- Keeps the newest row per item_id. Safe to re-run: a deduplicated table
-- deletes nothing, and the index creation is already idempotent.
