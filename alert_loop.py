    This is not hypothetical. The comps loop returned 0 items on all 40 of its

    covered by this check. Nothing surfaced it; the alert feed looked normal

    inside DEAD_MAN_COOLDOWN_HOURS logs instead of messaging. The marker write
    is a second `finish_run` update rather than a field on the first one, and

    `--loop` exists because the poll gap is the only part of the latency
    budget still worth attacking: Wallapop's indexing costs ~150-200s no
    matter what, so a 45s cadence lands near the floor while a 5-minute one
    adds ~2.5 minutes of pure waiting. Under GitHub Actions the default
    single-pass mode is still correct.

    The two modes want opposite things from a failure, which is why the `try`
    is conditional rather than universal:

      * single pass: re-raise. GitHub Actions decides whether the chain is
        healthy from the exit code, so swallowing a failure there would turn a
        broken deploy into a green build that alerts nobody.
      * `--loop`: log, back off, keep going. Persistent-host mode previously
        had no `try` at all around `while True`, so one transient Supabase blip
        — a connection reset, a 500, a statement timeout — ended the process
        permanently and silently, and the halved time-to-alert that is the
        entire point of this mode could not be relied on. run_once() already
        pings Telegram before re-raising, so the failure is never invisible.

    The backoff doubles per consecutive failure up to LOOP_BACKOFF_CAP_SECONDS
    so a hard outage (expired credentials, an API shape change) doesn't become
    a tight crash-loop hammering Wallapop and Telegram at 45-second intervals —
    which is a good way to convert a temporary problem into a rate-limit. A
    single successful pass resets it.
