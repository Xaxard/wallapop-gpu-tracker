/**
 * ==========================================================================
 *  PORT OF THE TRACKER'S FEE MODEL. KEEP IT IN STEP WITH ../../../config.py.
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * This file is a hand-maintained TypeScript transcription of `config.py`'s
 * `FeeModel` plus the deal gate in `pricing.py`'s `evaluate()`. Two independent
 * implementations of the same maths is the root cause of a whole class of bug
 * here, and it has already bitten: before this rewrite the dashboard's in-person
 * ceiling ignored `MARGIN_RATE` (every ceiling above ~278 EUR was too high), its
 * deal gate compared the raw asking price rather than the haggled offer to the
 * buy ceiling (so the dashboard and the Telegram feed disagreed about what a
 * deal even was), and nothing applied `MIN_PLAUSIBLE_RATIO` at all — which on a
 * list sorted by margin descending means replicas and empty boxes sort first.
 *
 * The real fix is for the tracker to persist or expose these numbers so there
 * is one source of truth. Until then, every one of the following env vars must
 * be set to the same value here as in the tracker's own environment:
 *
 *   SELLER_FEE  BUYER_FEE  BUYER_FIXED  SHIPPING_IN
 *   TARGET_MARGIN  MARGIN_RATE  SEED_MARGIN_MULTIPLIER
 *   OFFER_DISCOUNT  MIN_PLAUSIBLE_RATIO
 *   MIN_SANE_PRICE  MAX_SANE_PRICE  MAX_DEAL_PRICE  MAX_CAPITAL_PRICE
 *   BLOCKED_CONDITIONS  BLOCKED_SELLERS  ALERTING_FAMILIES
 *
 * The defaults below mirror config.py's defaults, with one exception noted at
 * SELLER_FEE. Defaults are a starting point, not a guarantee — check the
 * tracker's live env before trusting any figure this dashboard renders.
 *
 * A second section at the foot of this file ports `alert_loop`'s scope
 * rejections, which are *not* in `pricing.evaluate()` and were missing here
 * entirely — see the header on `alertScopeRejection`.

 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * `evaluateDeal` above is a faithful port of `pricing.evaluate()` — and that
 * was the whole problem, because `evaluate()` is not the only gate the tracker
 * applies. Before a listing is ever handed to it, `alert_loop` throws out four
 * classes of listing outright, and none of those rejections live in

 *
 *   1. families other than 'gpu'        (ALERTING_FAMILIES)
 *   2. whole machines                   (item.whole_machine)
 *   3. blocked sellers                  (config.BLOCKED_SELLERS)
 *   4. the bottom condition tier        (config.BLOCKED_CONDITIONS)
 *
 * All four are recorded on the `listings` row, so the dashboard can apply them
 * exactly rather than approximating. Without them the deal list is strictly
 * wider than the alert feed and disagrees with it about what a deal is, which
 * is the same class of bug as the fee-model drift documented at the top of this
 * file — just arriving through a different door.
 *

 * prebuilts included, precisely so their prices can inform the model. Those
