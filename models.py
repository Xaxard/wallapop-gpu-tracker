"""GPU title -> canonical model_key parser.

GPUs are the only product family this parser knows about, and deliberately so:
phone/iPhone tracking was tried and reverted, and the owner does not want other
families back. Anything that used to exist here to keep families apart has been
removed rather than left dormant.

Comps are only meaningful if a "4070" is never pooled with a "4070 Ti Super",
so every listing is normalised to a canonical key before it can be priced.

Rules:
  * most-specific pattern wins (ti super > ti > super > base), so the registry
    is ordered and the first match returns;
  * VRAM disambiguates the split SKUs (4060 Ti / 5060 Ti 8GB vs 16GB); the
    figure used is the one written *nearest the model number*, not the largest
    one in the string (see extract_vram); when the text doesn't say, it falls
    back to a separate generic key rather than guessing into one of the two
    pools;
  * the title is tried first and wins outright. Only if the title matches
    nothing at all is the description scanned, and such a match is capped at
    'medium' confidence — a description is far noisier than a title, so it may
    price a listing but must never outrank or override what the title says. A
    description naming more than one distinct card is capped at 'low' instead:
    a parts list or a bundle blurb gives no way to tell which card is for sale,
    and guessing systematically invents bargains (see classify);
  * confidence is 'high' only when a brand token (rtx/geforce/radeon/rx/...)
    backs up the number. A bare "4070" in a noisy title returns 'low', and the
    caller must not price a low-confidence match.

    A title match always wins and is never overridden: titles are what sellers
    put effort into and they name the thing being sold, while descriptions list
    the whole machine it came out of, the buyer's options, and what else the
    seller has for sale.

    The description pass exists because "Tarjeta gráfica Nvidia, pregunta por el
    modelo" style titles returned NO_MATCH, which made the listing unpriceable
    and therefore silent — and a vague title correlates with a seller who does
    not know what they have, which is exactly the population worth buying from.
    An *unambiguous* description — one that names a single card, however many
    times and however inconsistently — is capped at 'medium': still priceable,
    but structurally unable to outrank a title.

    A description naming *more than one* card is capped at 'low', which
    Match.priceable refuses, so it can never reach the margin engine. This branch
    exists to recover listings whose seller did not put the model in the title,
    and the value in those is precisely that the seller does not know what they
    have. A description listing several different cards is a different animal —
    a bundle, a parts list, a spec sheet, a "compatible con" blurb — and there is
    no reliable way to tell which one is for sale. Ambiguity should cost the match
    its priceability rather than resolve to the most expensive candidate, which is
    what the earlier first-registry-hit rule did: because the registry is ordered
    newest-first, the highest-tier card named always won, so the rule was
    systematically biased toward inventing bargains.

    That bias was not covered by any downstream guard. MIN_PLAUSIBLE_RATIO only
    catches gross mismatches — a 150 EUR card against a 1200 EUR 4090 reference
    is below 0.35*ref and is rejected — but adjacent-tier confusion, the common
    case, sails through: a 300 EUR card whose description also names a 4070 Ti
    Super (seed 520) sits well above 0.35*520 = 182, its 240 EUR offer clears the
    ~392 ceiling, and it alerts as a strong deal.

    The key from the winning registry entry is still returned on an ambiguous
    description, so logs and same_family() see what was recognised; it is the
    confidence, and therefore the pricing, that is withheld. A title match is
