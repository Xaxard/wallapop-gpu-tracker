# Server-side floor on every seeded search, alert and comps alike.

# page arrived with sub-50 EUR listings on it — which pricing.sane() then threw
# away locally, after they had already cost their slot on the page. Given how
# hard the search shape works to win page depth (the whole time_filter
# investigation in config.py exists to get a page from 16 items to 40), that was
# free depth left unclaimed for nothing.

# MIN_SANE_PRICE is the right number rather than MIN_COMP_PRICE, because this

# by either loop: an alert can't fire on it and it can't enter the comps pool.
# A real GPU under 50 EUR is a dead card, a replica, a bare cooler or bait —
# never a flip and never a comp — so filtering it at the server costs nothing
# and buys back page slots for listings that can actually be acted on.
