"""Comps aggregation and the flip-margin engine.

The reference price is deliberately *not* the mean of active asking prices —
those are aspirational. It's the trimmed median of what the market actually
transacted at: reserved listings (someone agreed to buy) plus listings inferred
sold (reserved, then vanished).

INVARIANT — what may enter the reference-price pool:
  * an observation with status == 'reserved' (a buyer committed at that price);
  * a listing inferred sold, contributing its sold_price;
  * nothing else. An *active* asking price may never become a comp, at any
    price, under any confidence, via any code path. Sellers can ask whatever
    they like; a pool of asks measures optimism, not the market, and the
    reference price is what every buy ceiling in the bot is derived from.
  * and every admitted price must clear comp_sane() — config.MIN_COMP_PRICE at
    the bottom, not MIN_SANE_PRICE, because the pool floor and the
    "is this listing worth alerting on" floor are separate questions.

collect_comps() is the only place a price enters the pool, so that is where the
invariant is enforced: the two loops it reads from (db.reserved_comps,
db.sold_comps) are status-filtered at the query, and comp_sane() is applied to
both branches. Anything added here later must go through the same two doors.
