# Hard ceiling on liveness probes per run.
#
# `infer_sales` used to probe every open listing missing from a run, uncapped
# and with no pause between requests — unlike the search path, which sleeps
# REQUEST_DELAY between pages. Each probe can spend up to 14s inside the retry
# backoff on a 403, so as `listings` grows this was the likeliest way to hit the
# 70-minute workflow timeout, and the fastest way to earn a rate-limit that
# looks exactly like the geolocation failure config.py documents at length.
#
# 50 probes at REQUEST_DELAY=1.0 is ~1 minute of the hourly budget in the good
# case. Anything not probed this run simply falls back to the missing_runs
# counter, which is the pre-existing behaviour and loses nothing beyond an hour
# of latency on the closure.

    """Run-scoped memo over `db.sold_comps`, transparent for everything else.

    The comps loop asked for the same rows twice per model: once directly (for
    median days-to-sale) and once inside `pricing.collect_comps`, which fetches
    its own. At ~40 models that is ~80 round trips a run spent re-reading an
    answer already in memory, and generic keys made it worse — a split-VRAM
    sibling is queried once as its own target and again when the generic key
    borrows from it.

    Caching for the duration of the repricing loop is safe because every
    closure this run will write has already been written: `infer_sales` runs to
    completion before repricing starts, so nothing can change `sold_comps`'
    answer underneath. It is deliberately *not* held across runs.

    `pricing` may not be edited from here, so this is how one fetch reaches
    both callers through its existing `sold_rows` parameter.

    The key is the model alone, deliberately, and that is the whole mechanism:
    every caller derives `since` as `now() - COMPS_WINDOW_DAYS` from its own
    `now()`, so the two windows differ by the microseconds between the two
    calls. Keying on the timestamp would therefore never hit. A row could in
    principle sit inside that gap — meaning it closed almost exactly 60 days
    ago, at a time-decay weight of ~0.05 — which is not a difference any
    reference price can express. The first caller's window is the one used.

    Wallapop exposes no sold feed, so absence has always been the proxy. But
    absence from *our search results* is a weak signal — a listing that merely
    slid down the ranking looks identical to one that sold. The detail endpoint
    settles it directly: it 404s once a listing is gone, so `wp` upgrades the
    heuristic into a fact.

    That cuts both ways, and both directions matter:
      * confirmed gone -> close it now, instead of waiting out
        MISSING_RUNS_FOR_SALE more hourly runs (~2h of stale ceilings);
      * confirmed alive -> reset the counter, which stops a listing that simply
        fell out of the rankings from ever being booked as a phantom sale.

    A failed request returns None and falls back to the counter — a network
    blip must never be read as a sale.

    Probing is bounded on both axes, which it was not:

      * only reserved listings are probed, via `db.open_reserved_listings`. That
        query was written for exactly this ("the only ones worth spending a
        detail request on") and had no callers — the optimisation was designed
        and never wired up. A never-reserved listing cannot produce a sold comp
        anyway: `mark_closed(item_id, None)` is all it can ever yield, so a
        request confirming it is gone buys nothing but the hour of latency the
        missing_runs counter already covers.
      * at most MAX_LIVENESS_PROBES per run, with config.REQUEST_DELAY between
        them, matching how polite the search path already is.
